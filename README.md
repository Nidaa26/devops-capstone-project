## Overview

A Flask-based REST API microservice that lets client applications **Create,
Read, Update, Delete, and List** customer Accounts. Built as part of an
Agile/DevOps capstone project: TDD-driven development, CI with GitHub Actions,
security headers via Flask-Talisman, containerization with Docker, and
deployment to Kubernetes/OpenShift via a Tekton CD pipeline.
